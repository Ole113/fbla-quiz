    - Have documentation show the path that components take to be rendered Ex. in words and drawings explain:
        index.js
            App.js
                Landing.js
                    Navbar.js
                    Nav.js
                    ...
    - Documentation and JS Doc<br /><br />

## Main: Program documentation is readable, useful, and complete<br />
Max Points: Program documentation invites use of advanced features<br />
    - Make the repo public and make it so the user can download it and run the server along with the backend server. Let the user upload their own questions
    - Make a "compiler" folder with a Readme.md that takes a text file with the format:
        host: //user SQL hostname
        user: //user username
        password: //user password
        database: //user SQL database
        This is the question
        [option1, option2, option3, option4]
        multi
        and so forth...
    - In the compiler folder then have a compile.js and do the same thing as in Antiquity and upload all of the questions to the database using a for loop. Have correct error handeling. In Readme.md have a common errors section(db not connecting etc..)
