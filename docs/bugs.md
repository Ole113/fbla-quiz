There is a major bug when loading random some questions can't be clicked some move other ones and what not. Probably an issue with ids or something.

Error messages is not thrown correctly when there's not enough TF or matching questions.

When the output report is showing and the Quiz button is clicked in the navbar the output report stays there.
