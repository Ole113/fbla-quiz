Hello my name is Alex Elbel. I made FBLA Quiz using React.js for the frontend, Node.js for the backend, and MySQL for data storage.

**Home Page:**
When FBLA Quiz first loads you're greated with aesthetic colorful, and interactive components. 
The large title draws the users eyes into the important part of the website. 
Below the title is a call to action button that navigates to the main part of the website, the Quiz section. 
To the right of the title is an interactive card[Show how the menu is interactive] containing some basic info about the various components of FBLA Quiz.
At the top of the page there is a navigation bar along with an interactive help menu. [Click on the help menu and show how it is interactive] The help menu contains basic help information in regards to how FBLA Quiz works.
[Close out of the help menu] Continuing down the page the user is greated with 3 points that contain short information about FBLA Quiz.
The last part of the home page is 2 cards that contain more detailed information about the services that FBLA Quiz offers.
[Click on the card that navigates to quiz]

**Quiz Page:**
The quiz page is split into 2 different parts, on the left is the quiz options, which includes the number of questions and the type of questions.
On the right is the quiz questions.
When navigating between pages react renders them as a single page application which means the website doesn't need to load a new page. You can see that if I navigate back to the home page the content is instantly rendered and the website doesn't show any apparent loading.
Another example of this is changing the question types or the number of questions [Change the quesiton type and add a couple extra questions] as you can see these questions and page changing are dynamically rendered.
