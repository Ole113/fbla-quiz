## Introduction:
    - Reusable UI components such as the navbar
    - Single-page applications, can update the page without reloading

## Demonstration flowed in a logical sequence; statements were well organized
    - Make sure to include the key words for every point in presentation.

## Reports allow user to customize and analyze information
    - **Let users change data graph to pie chart, bar chart, etc...**
    - **Use localstorage to save the result of each quiz. The user can customize the graph to show their average scores over x amount of time.**

## Program results update dynamically and are error free
    - Quiz questions are added dynamically
    - Pages load dynamically

## Program use also includes an intelligent feature such as an interactive Q&A, Interface contains no spelling errors, has interactive help menu, and has no navigation errors
    - Navbar to easily navigate around website along with footer links.
    - Right side of navbar has a interactive help menu.
    - **NEED INTERACTICE Q&A**

## Data storage includes dynamic backup feature, Data storage is clear, and storage is secure 
    - Data is stored in MySQL database.
    - The CRON tab updates the backup file every 3 hours.
    - The database config file is in the .gitignore and the database password is very secure(use a random password generator).

## Identifiers exhibit an advanced knowledge of programming and are accurate in all instances
    - Keep variable names as advanced as possible even if it makes it harder to understand the program.
    - Mention camel case / Snake case / all caps constants
    - **Make method names that are private have an _ before them**.
