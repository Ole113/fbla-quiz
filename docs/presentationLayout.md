## Introduction:
    - Reusable UI components such as the navbar
    - Single-page applications, can update the page without reloading
    - When new components are rendered only that node is updated not the whole page.

## Demonstration flowed in a logical sequence; statements were well organized
    - 
## Reports allow user to customize and analyze information
    - Let users change data graph to pie chart, bar chart, etc...
    - Use localstorage to save the result of each quiz. The user can customize the graph to show their average scores over x amount of time.

## Program results update dynamically and are error free
    - Quiz questions are added dynamically
    - Pages update dynamically

## Program use also includes an intelligent feature such as an interactive Q&A


## Program sequence is logical, error free, and incorporates if-then sequences

## Data storage includes dynamic backup feature
    - https://searchdatabackup.techtarget.com/definition/hot-backup
    - Every Three hours write from server.js to the backup 

## Identifiers exhibit an advanced knowledge of programming
    - Keep variable names as advanced as possible even if it makes it harder to understand the program.
    - Mention camel case / Snake case / all caps constants
    - Make method names that are private have an _ before them.
