1. Fix the styling of matching question type 


***************************************************

Not all questions are required
Add hrs in between matching questions
Make the text not black
Maybe make headers have a lighter color of gray

Bug where if where you are rendering questions and you are on any question type but its easiest with multiple
So first you render 5 or so multiple questions and then reduce to 1, then repeat and eventually it will run out of list to render from.
Matching is totally broken, sometimes when submitted you're responses are totally wrongly recorded. sometimes the answers aren't even for the questions.
