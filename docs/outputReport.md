*Output reports allow user to customize and analyze information*

When the user submits the quiz at the very top have the score the user got with a gradient button next to it that says "Retake".
Then have a "hr" below it seperating them.
Below that have a couple pie charts(maybe 2 or so) of what scores the user got on the left and then on the right side have the users scores for that session. Store this information
in local storage.
**On this score history have the ability to see scores over last x time period this allows users to customize information**
